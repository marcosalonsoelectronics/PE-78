Material of video PE #78: Dynamic Response of DC-DC Converters under Constant On-Time (COT) Voltage Control

Available at: https://youtu.be/zt9SOAT5oe4

This video explains the operation of constant-on-time (COT) voltage control of DC-DC converters, including its dynamic response. This control method uses the output voltage ripple to drive the switch using a on-shot circuit. The valley value of the output voltage ripple is used as control parameter. The static and dynamic behaviors are analyzed. Qspice simulations are used to illustrate the different ideas and verify the theoretical analysis.
